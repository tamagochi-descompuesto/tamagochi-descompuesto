### Hi there! üëã

#### - üíª I‚Äôm currently studying computer science.
#### - ‚òÅÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on projects related to AI, backend web development and cloud computing.
#### - üë®‚Äçüíº My work: 
  - üéÆ [Videogame Development](https://github.com/tamagochi-descompuesto/STEAMVideogame) _(February 2021 - May 2021)_:  
    I was involved in the development of an educational videogame for the non-profit association **Movimiento STEAM** to encourage boys and girls to study science, technology, engineering, arts or math-related careers. I learned to use Unity, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, Node.js and this was my first experience with cloud computing.  
**Video y sinchos perrones del videojuego**  
I also developed a [web server application](https://github.com/tamagochi-descompuesto/STEAMVideogameServer) to connect various services with the videogame and deploy a full-stack application.  

- üì± [Mobile app Development](https://github.com/tamagochi-descompuesto/MobileAppDUM) _(August 2021 - October 2021)_:  
  I developed a mobile app for the non-profit organization **Dibujando un Ma√±ana** for fundraising and to inform more people about the works of the association. The application was made only for Android devices using Android Studio and Kotlin. I learned about UI design and how to deploy mobile applications.   
**Sinchos perrones de la app**  
In addition to this, I also developed a [web server application](https://github.com/tamagochi-descompuesto/ServerMobileAppDUM) to deploy correctly all the functionalities of the app.  

- üß† [Multi-agent system modelation](https://github.com/tamagochi-descompuesto/CrossRoadMultiAgentSystem) _(October 2021 - December 2021)_:  
  I worked with **IBM** using **IBM Cloud** from to model and develop a multi-agent system to model a crossroad and how the cars are suposed to cross in order to have a quick transit flow. This was my first approach to AI and its different models, I modeled and coded the decisions and behaviors of the agents that conformed the system. In the repository linked in the title of this section you can find the model and implementation described with more detail _(english translation is in progress)_.  
**Sinchos perrones del sistema**  
During this project I worked again with cloud computing, modeled the system and server with Python and made a graphic representation of the crossroad using Unity.  

- üìû [Amazon Capstone Project](https://github.com/Amazon-Connect-Equipo-1/Wiki/wiki) _(February 2022 - June 2022)_:  
  This one is my biggest project up to date. I worked with Amazon to develop a screen-recordings functionality for their service _Amazon Connect_. Working with a team of 20 people we developed a full-stack application with a bank-oriented business model called [Bankonnect](https://www.bankonnect.link/login) (I hope the domain is still working by now). I learned many technologies of Amazon such as S3, Route53, DynamoDB, RDS, EC2 etc. but most importantly I learned the experience to develop a big software project with several people giving me many skills of project management and leadership.  
 **Sinchos perrones del sistema**  
 In the repository linked in the title of the section you can find all the documentation generated for the project that explains in detail all the aspects of the prject as well as the individual repositories for each component of the application. This is the project I am most proud of because of the results and the quantity of functionalities we achieved and developed as a team.
